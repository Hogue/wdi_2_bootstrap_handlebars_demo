## Templating

By now, we know how to render static html. What happens when we want to render data from another source?

## Handlebars

Handlebars is a javascript templating library.

Rendering objects with handlebars templates is a three step process:

1. Create a template in a script tag on your html page
2. Compile the template to create a templating function
3. Pass the object(s) that you want to render into the templating function

## 1. Creating the template

Our client wants us to create a Game of Thrones fansite.

Please run `grunt serve` and navigate to localhost:9000
